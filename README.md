# Graduation Project – GANs & Sound Sonification

Code for my Bachelor's graduation project combining **GAN-generated images** and **data-driven sound**.

Two GANs were trained on photographs taken in **Bucharest** and **London**.  
The full training outputs were used to create a short video exploring memory, transition, and identity:

Field recordings from both locations were analyzed (frequency + decibel data) and sonified into two MIDI-based compositions.

**Tech:** Python, Jupyter, GANs, NumPy, PyDub, MIDIUtil
