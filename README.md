# GraduationProject
This is the repository for my code for the graduation project. <br> <br><br>
bucharest_GAN and london_GAN were used to train my GANs. (the code differs between the 2 files)<br><br>
sonifying_data_bucharest and sonifying_data_london were used to create the sound (the code is the same, only the values differ)<br><br>
convet_to_wav is the code I used to convert the field recordings to wav files<br><br>
scientific_buc and scientific_ldn are the files I used to extract the db and frequency data out of my field recordings to then store<br>
them into a csv file (only the data differs, code is the same)
